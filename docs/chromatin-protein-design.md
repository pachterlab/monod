# Design: a joint chromatin, RNA and protein model

Status: design, 2026-11-02. Nothing in this document is implemented yet.

## What the model is

One gene, four observed modalities per cell: nascent RNA, mature RNA, protein and
the chromatin configuration of a locus of `n` binary sites. The mechanism is the
existing `Chromatin` model with the existing protein step added downstream of the
mature RNA:

```
sites open/close        k_on[i], k_off = 1, Ising coupling epsilon        (Chromatin)
configuration -> nascent  transcription rule: switch / additive / table    (Chromatin)
                          single molecules, or geometric bursts of mean b  (Chromatin, bursty=True)
nascent -> mature         beta                                             (Chromatin)
mature -> 0               gamma                                            (Chromatin)
mature -> mature + P      k_p                                              (ProteinBursty)
P -> 0                    gamma_p                                          (ProteinBursty)
```

Nothing couples the protein back to the chromatin or the RNA, so the protein
inherits the configuration's influence only through the mature RNA. That is the
reason the kernel composes (next section) and also the reason to expect the
configuration to carry little information about the protein unless the sites
switch slowly compared with the protein lifetime.

Technical noise is the union of what the two models already have: Poisson or
Bernoulli capture on the two RNA channels (with the gene-length offset), ATAC
dropout on the configuration axis as the third sampling parameter, nothing on
the protein channel (as in `ProteinBursty`). The ambiguous channel works without
further work: it enlarges the two RNA axes of the latent model and splits the
counts afterwards, which is model-agnostic.

## Why the kernel composes

The chromatin kernel integrates the vector generating function
`G[c, p] = E[prod_j (1 + u_j)^{x_j}; configuration c]` by Strang splitting with
three exact sub-flows per step:

1. production, diagonal in `c`: `G[c, p] *= exp(A[c] * integral of phi(U_nascent(s, p)) ds)`;
2. configuration transitions: `G <- exp(H^T h) G`;
3. production again over the second half step.

`U(s, p)` is the characteristic of the RNA system started at the mesh point `p`:
today `U(s) = exp(C s) u` with `C` the splicing/degradation matrix, in closed
form, and identical for every configuration.

The protein model's characteristics, in the variables `v = u_U + 1`,
`w = u_S + 1`, `u_P`:

```
u_P(t) = u_P(0) exp(-gamma_p t)                       closed form
v'     = beta (w - v)
w'     = a(t) w + gamma,   a(t) = -gamma + k_p u_P(t)
```

are a linear system with one time-varying coefficient, and `protein_pgf`
propagates the homogeneous part of `w` exactly per step and treats the forcing
and the `v` coupling with the step-average coefficient. They still do not depend
on the configuration, because the configuration only sets the nascent production
rate `A[c]`.

So the joint kernel is the chromatin stepper with one substitution: the
characteristic provider. Where `_production_exponent` evaluates
`exp(C s) u` (constitutive, closed form) or at three Simpson nodes (bursty), it
instead evaluates the protein characteristic at those times. Sub-flow 2 is
unchanged. The production exponent still only reads the nascent characteristic
`U_nascent(s, p)`, through `phi(U) = U` or `U / (1 - b U)`.

Consequences:

- The step-doubling error control of the chromatin kernel covers the
  characteristic integration as well, provided the characteristic is advanced
  with the same step `h` the stepper is trying (one full step against two half
  steps), as the protein integrator does on its own.
- The pinned-schedule contract (replay the base point's steps at every stencil
  point) carries over unchanged: the schedule is the chromatin stepper's.
- The Rust kernel `eval_chromatin_pgf` needs a protein branch: today it takes
  `C` and builds `exp(C s)`; it would take `(beta, gamma, k_p, gamma_p)` and the
  protein mesh row, and run the protein characteristic update inside its step.
  The Python mirror comes first.

## Model definition

```python
CMEModel("Chromatin", "Poisson", n_sites=2, rule="switch", bursty=True,
         protein=True, protein_limit=20)
```

or, through the compositional constructor, which is where the model naturally
lives once built (today that call raises NotImplementedError pointing here):

```python
CMEModel.compose("bursty", locus=dict(n_sites=2, rule="switch"), protein=dict(protein_limit=20),
                 seq_model="Poisson")
```

- Modalities: `['unspliced', 'spliced', 'protein', 'configuration']`. The
  configuration stays last (sampling vector indices unchanged: `samp[0:2]` RNA
  capture, `samp[2]` ATAC dropout), protein sits where `ProteinBursty` puts it.
- Parameters: `[k_on_1..n, epsilon, rule rates, beta, gamma, (b), k_p, gamma_p]`,
  log10. The protein pair goes last so that every existing chromatin index is
  unchanged; `split_theta`, `join_theta`, `n_params`, `burst_size` and
  `embed_in_table` take a `protein` flag. Bounds for `k_p`, `gamma_p` as in
  `ProteinBursty` (`[-1.8, 3.5]`).
- `protein_limit` coarse-grains the protein axis of the mesh exactly as
  `ProteinBursty` does; the inversion reuses the protein model's zero-padded
  3-D inverse transform, applied per configuration.
- `fit_unspliced=False` is not offered: the nascent channel is where the
  configuration acts.
- Serialisation: `protein` joins `_CTOR_KEYS`; `to_dict` writes it with the
  chromatin block.

## Fitting

- Optimiser: the scipy path with central finite differences and pinned
  schedules, as for `Chromatin` today. The Nelder-Mead pre-search that
  `ProteinBursty` uses by default (`presearch="auto"`) is enabled for
  `protein=True`, because the `k_p`/`gamma_p` valley is the same valley.
- Moments start, in `chromatin_fit.chromatin_start`:
  1. chain from the configuration marginal (sum over the three count axes),
     dropout fixed from the sampling vector, as now;
  2. rule rates from the conditional nascent means per configuration, `gamma`
     from the mature mean, `beta` from the short scan, as now, on the histogram
     with the protein axis summed out;
  3. `k_p / gamma_p` from `E[P] = (k_p / gamma_p) E[S]`, `gamma_p` from a short
     scan (`{0.1, 1, 10} * gamma`) under the model's own divergence, the pattern
     `beta` already follows. The covariance-based formula of `ProteinBursty` is
     an option but it is the step that failed most often there.
- Standard errors: `compute_sigma` unchanged; expect the valley flag to fire on
  genes where protein turns over faster than mRNA.
- Nested comparisons: `compare_nested_models` works as now between rules and
  emissions at fixed `protein=True`; `protein=False` against `protein=True` is
  not a nesting (a different data space), it is a different model of the same
  cells only once the protein layer is dropped, so no test is offered there.

## Data path

`chromatin_data.build_multiome_adata(rna, atac, genes, ..., protein=None,
protein_map=None)`:

- `protein` is an AnnData of antibody counts (ADT) on the same cells;
  `protein_map` maps gene name to antibody name (`{"CD14": "CD14"}`); genes
  without an antibody are dropped from the fit with a log message, since a
  protein model needs a protein count.
- Writes an integer `protein` layer next to `unspliced`, `spliced` and
  `configuration`; `extract_data` then needs nothing new beyond the model's
  modality list (filters: the protein entry of `ProteinBursty`'s filter box).
- Cells are matched by barcode; the three assays must come from the same
  cell. TEA-seq and DOGMA-seq produce this; the BMMC multiome does not have
  protein.

## Cost

Mesh points: `lu * ls * (lp_coarse // 2 + 1)` with `N = 2**n` configurations
each. For a gene like PTPRC (limits 81, 44, 86 with `protein_limit=20` so
`lp_coarse` about 5) that is about 11 k points by 4 configurations, the size of
the two-site chromatin fits that run today in tens of milliseconds per
evaluation in Rust. The protein characteristic adds one closed-form update per
mesh point per sub-step. In Python expect a few seconds per evaluation, enough
to validate on synthetic data, not to fit panels; the Rust branch is what makes
real data feasible.

## Validation plan, in order

1. **Python kernel, limits.** A one-site `switch` locus with `k_on >> 1`
   (always open) and `bursty=True` must reproduce `ProteinBursty(b, beta,
   gamma, k_p, gamma_p)` on the protein-coarse grid to the integrator's
   tolerance; `k_p -> 0` must reproduce `Chromatin` with a delta at protein
   zero; `gamma_p -> infinity` with `k_p / gamma_p` fixed must give a protein
   that tracks the mature count (its conditional mean `(k_p / gamma_p) S`).
2. **Simulation.** Add the protein reactions to the chromatin simulator in
   `monod.simulate` and register the model in `tests/test_generative_checks.py`:
   moments, histogram divergence and parameter recovery against cells drawn
   from the process with capture, dropout and the ambiguous split on.
3. **Contract tests.** Register the kernel in the contract suite: replay
   equality under a pinned schedule, finite-difference gradient against a
   displaced evaluation, thread-pool consistency, MLE recovery on simulated
   data, nesting of `switch` and `additive` in `table` with protein present.
4. **Pipeline.** `perform_inference` on a synthetic four-layer AnnData with a
   three-point dropout grid and Poisson capture; the ambiguous channel on top
   through the generic route; h5ad round trip of the model definition.
5. **Rust.** Port the protein characteristic into `eval_chromatin_pgf` under a
   flag, Python against Rust at every mesh point, then the timing.

Stages 1 to 4 are Python only and self-contained; stage 5 is the port.

## Open decisions

- **Protein measurement noise.** `ProteinBursty` has none, and ADT counts carry
  a known ambient background. A per-dataset background rate on the protein
  channel would be a fourth sampling parameter on the grid, in the mould of the
  ATAC dropout. Deferred unless a dataset shows it matters.
- **Emission default.** The BMMC analysis made `bursty=True` the sensible
  default for real data; the constitutive emission stays available for the
  limits and the nested comparisons.
- **Name.** A flag on `Chromatin` (`protein=True`) keeps one family and one
  parameter convention; a separate `bio_model` name would duplicate the
  chromatin options.
- **Fitting the protein pair at all.** On loci where the configuration carries
  no information about the RNA, the protein adds a layer downstream of an
  uninformative one. The first fits should be on genes with a surface-protein
  readout and a locus that switches slowly, and they should start with the
  check the chromatin notebook recommends: mean RNA and mean protein per
  configuration before any fit.
